After identifying these models, users can create an API key in their profile, which is essential for authenticating requests. The guide further details how to configure the API by locating the base URL and entering the API key into the configuration file. Finally, it explains how to identify free models in the 'pair' chat interface, ensuring users can effectively utilize the available resources without incurring costs.


## Summary 
### Accessing Free API Keys
To begin using the services offered by OpenRouter.ai, users need to create an account. This is done by visiting the OpenRouter.ai website, signing in, and using a Google account for quick access.

### Creating and Managing API Keys
After identifying the free models, the next step involves creating an API key. This is accomplished by accessing the profile section and selecting the keys option. Users should create a new key, assigning it a recognizable name, such as 'pair AI', and ensure they copy it down securely, as it will not be visible again once generated. This key is crucial for authenticating API requests and should be stored safely, such as in a notepad, to prevent loss.

### Configuring the API for Use
With the API key in hand, users must locate the base URL necessary for API interactions. This information can be found in the documentation section of the OpenRouter.ai website. Once the base URL is obtained, users should navigate to their application, in this case, 'pair', and initiate the configuration process. This involves accessing the config.json file, where the model settings can be adjusted. A critical feature of this setup is the auto-detection capability, which allows the application to automatically recognize and populate the available models based on the configured settings.

### Populating Configuration Settings
Upon accessing the configuration file, users need to input the base URL and API key into their respective fields. This is done by pasting the base URL and entering the API key, ensuring that the provider is set correctly to 'Open AI', which is compatible with the models being utilized. Users can also customize the display name for the API provider in the 'pair' chat interface. After making these adjustments, it is important to save the configuration to ensure that changes are retained for future use.

### Utilizing and Identifying Free Models
Once the configuration is complete, users can access the 'pair' chat interface, where all available models will be listed. However, to distinguish the free models from the paid ones, users must look for tags or indicators that denote a model as free. These tags typically appear at the end of the model name. For instance, a model like 'metal llama 3.18 B instruct free' would indicate it is available at no cost. Users may need to explore the list to find the specific free models they wish to utilize.
