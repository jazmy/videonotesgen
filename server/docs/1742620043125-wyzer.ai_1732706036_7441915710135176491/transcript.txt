(00:00:00) to go to bolt dot new, we're going to go code this code this. Now, okay
(00:00:05) , I think I put it in a loop of asking me too many questions. So here we go, boom,
(00:00:10) code this. Now let's see what happens. Okay, boom, it's coding. So let's see what happens
(00:00:15) after all these changes. I mean, this is just so many changes here before I ever even let it code again. But
(00:00:20) this is actually really, really good stuff in that memory full. And then it's kind of like pulling the rubber
(00:00:25) band back and then it's letting it loose. We're coding, coding, coding
(00:00:30) . I mean, it's just going to go on. I'd love to make the video longer, but I can't. It's still thinking
(00:00:35) I really stuffed that memory full. So container izing, updating
(00:00:40) , even more code. So it's still going. I want to show you
(00:00:45) everything I think I'll have to fast forward all this, I guess. This
(00:00:50) is in real time right now. Here
(00:00:55) we go. Let's see it. Come on. What do we have here?
(00:01:00) This is going to be crazy. Show me. Tell me my ad, my ad key works
(00:01:05) . Yes.
